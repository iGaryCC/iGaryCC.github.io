“Wow! I could also live like this!”

First day at Hwa Nan in 1989, I had no high expectations. Little did I know my life changed when I met my first foreign teacher Krysten Gramberg from NY. She brought her free sprite to our lives like a tornado. I wanted to live like her so free and full of energy. In my foreign teachers classes learning became fun; In my foreign teacher’s classes, I learned to think and live for me;  In my foreign teacher’s classes, I found myself. 

Thank you Hwa Nan!
